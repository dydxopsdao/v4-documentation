## Goals

This document contains instructions to do the following steps:

- Initialize the node (i.e. setting up home directory)
- Set up your validator credentials
- Adding genesis accounts (i.e. creating `gentx`)
- Submit `gentx` to the mainnet repo

These are necessary steps to register your validator in the genesis and prepare for network startup.

## Timeline

See the [Mainnet Launch Schedule](https://dydx-chain-docs.vercel.app/mainnet/schedule) for `dydx-mainnet-1`. Please make sure to prepare your `DYDX` tokens for self-delegation, and submit your gentx by the deadlines highlighted in the schedule.

## Preparing `DYDX` for self-delegation

To participate in the potential Genesis process, there is a requirement for genesis Validators to self-delegate `DYDX` tokens, which necessitates locking `DYDX` on Ethereum ([Blogpost 1](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/exploring-the-future-of-dydx), [Blogpost 2](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/update-on-exploring-the-future-of-dydx), [Community Docs](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-token-migration/migration-of-dydx-from-ethereum-to-dydx-chain/migration-and-bridge-overview), [Community Proposal](https://dydx.community/dashboard/proposal/15)).

To approve the `wethDYDX` Smart Contract to transfer the bridging amount of `DYDX` on your behalf
1. navigate to [`approve` function](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92D6C1e31e14520e676a687F0a93788B716BEff5#writeContract#F2) of the `DYDX` Token on Etherscan
2. click `Connect to Web3`
4. input
    - `spender` address - [`wethDYDX` Smart Contract Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b2deae6eff3011008ea27ea36b7c27255ddfa9)(`0x46b2DeAe6eFf3011008EA27EA36b7c27255ddFA9`)
    - approval `amount`, e.g. `1000000000000000000000` for bridging `1000 DYDX` tokens ([`decimals` for `DYDX`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92D6C1e31e14520e676a687F0a93788B716BEff5#readContract#F24) is `18`)
6. click `Write` and sign the transaction

Make sure you have access to your `accAddress` for dYdX Chain - you will need to provide it to the `wethDYDX` Ethereum contract (this is your `delegator_address` in `genesis.json`, for more on Cosmos Addresses, you can check [this link](https://twitter.com/JoeAbbey/status/1633474883815456769)).

Transform your `accAddress` to hexidecimal bytes
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-chain.git
cd v4-chain/protocol
go run scripts/bech32_to_hex/bech32_to_hex.go -address <bech32_address>
```

To initiate the migration of your self-delegation `DYDX` amount from Ethereum
1. navigate to the [`bridge` function](https://etherscan.io/address/0x46b2deae6eff3011008ea27ea36b7c27255ddfa9#writeContract#F2) of `wethDYDX` on Etherscan
2. click `Connect to Web3`
3. input the bridging parameters
    - `amount` - e.g. `1000000000000000000000` for bridging `1000 DYDX`
    - `accAddress` - in its hexidecimal form acquired above, make sure the value starts with `0x`
    - `memo` - use `0x` to pass in empty value
5. click `Write` and sign the transaction

You can use the `bridge_events.go` script to validate your bridging transaction has been recorded successfully
```bash
go run scripts/bridge_events/bridge_events.go \
  -denom adydx \
  -address 0x46b2DeAe6eFf3011008EA27EA36b7c27255ddFA9 \
  -rpc <rpc_node_url> \
  -toblock <last_block_inclusive>
```

In case you would like to experiment with bridging on Sepolia first, you can use [testTOKEN](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x6D5Bb505A4f85C10B122cCC36E30F57E2B86A291) and [wrappedTestToken](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xcca9D5f0a3c58b6f02BD0985fC7F9420EA24C1f0).

## Get the `dydxprotocold` binary

Download the latest binaries from [dYdX Protocol Github Repo](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-chain/releases).

Choose the version (e.g. `"v0.4.0"`), and binary (`linux-amd64` as example) for the corresponding platform, and set up in $PATH:

```bash
# Set the desired version
export BINARY_VERSION=<version>
# Choose a platform. Supported: linux-amd64, linux-arm64
export DYDX_PLATFORM=<platform>
tar -xvzf dydxprotocold-$BINARY_VERSION-${DYDX_PLATFORM}.tar.gz
mkdir -p "${HOME}/local/bin"
export PATH="${HOME}/local/bin:$PATH"
cp build/dydxprotocold-$BINARY_VERSION-${DYDX_PLATFORM} "${HOME}/local/bin/dydxprotocold"
rm -R build 
```

Verify the binary version:

```bash
dydxprotocold version --long
```

The output should look like this (**make sure** the `version` and `commit` is consistent):

```bash
commit: 6ed30700011e4d4433272286afaed1465ae71dc3
cosmos_sdk_version: v0.47.3
go: go version go1.19.9 <platform>
name: dydxprotocol
server_name: dydxprotocold
version: <version>
```

## Initialize your node

Initialize the home directory for `dydxprotocold`. **Please note:** we are using `chain-id=dydx-mainnet-1` for public mainnet.

```bash
# Use a new home directory for mainnet.
export HOME_MAINNET_1=~/.dydx-mainnet-1
# Choose a moniker as the custom username of your node. It should be human-readable.
export DYDX_MONIKER=<moniker>
# Configure chain ID.
export CHAIN_ID=dydx-mainnet-1
# Init the home directory
dydxprotocold init --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID --home=$HOME_MAINNET_1 $DYDX_MONIKER
```

## Saving/Recovering Consensus Keys

Be sure to **make a copy** of the key pair json `priv_validator_key.json` and `node_key.json` under `$HOME_MAINNET_1/config`, as these key pairs are generated during `dydxprotocold init ....` and **cannot** be recovered later unless they were explicitly derived through the mnemonics.

If you've previously created a `gentx` and are recovering your home directory, you will need to replace the default `priv_validator_key.json` and `node_key.json` files with the files backed up from above.

## Import/Create Validator Key

You could either create a new key for the mainnet, or import an existing key. 

**Option 1: Creating a New Key**

‚ö†Ô∏è The below keyrings are examples, we do not recommend using `test` for production.

```bash
# Generate key-ring. 
# Using the `test` keyring-backend as example. 
# Feel free to choose the keyring backend as you like. 
export DYDX_KEY_NAME=<key_name>
dydxprotocold keys add $DYDX_KEY_NAME --keyring-backend test --home=$HOME_MAINNET_1
```

**Option 2: Import Via Mnemonic**

To import via mnemonic, you can do so using the following command and then input your mnemonic when prompted.

```bash
export DYDX_KEY_NAME=<key_name>
dydxprotocold keys add $DYDX_KEY_NAME --recover --keyring-backend test --home=$HOME_MAINNET_1
```

**Store validator address as envvar**

```bash
MY_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=$(dydxprotocold keys show $DYDX_KEY_NAME -a --keyring-backend test --home=$HOME_MAINNET_1)
```

## Create `gentx`

### Download pregenesis.json

We recommend you use the `pregenesis.json` published in dYdX Operations subDAO's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dydxopsdao/networks/tree/main/dydx-mainnet-1).

Download `pregenesis.json` file into `$HOME_MAINNET_1`, replacing the previous `genesis.json` file:
```bash
# Run at root of `networks`.
export HOME_MAINNET_1=<your dir>
git checkout main
git pull origin main
cp dydx-mainnet-1/pregenesis.json $HOME_MAINNET_1/config/genesis.json
```

Feel free to inspect the content of the `pregenesis.json` file, and let us know if there‚Äôs any questions/concerns.

### Generate `gentx`

Use `gentx` command to create your genesis transaction in `$HOME_MAINNET_1/gentx/`.

You can also use the below optional flags:

```bash
  --website="xxx" \
  --details="xxx" \
  --identity="xxx" \
  --pubkey="xxx"
```

You may consider self-delegating slightly less than 100% of your bridged DYDX tokens.

```bash
dydxprotocold gentx $DYDX_KEY_NAME <self-delegation amount>adydx --moniker $DYDX_MONIKER --keyring-backend test --chain-id $CHAIN_ID --home=$HOME_MAINNET_1
```

It will output something similar to:

```bash
Genesis transaction written to "/Users/XXX/.dydx-mainnet-1/config/gentx/gentx-ae8a1fd5828866c435f9b559fad39e1bc19a06dc.json"
```

See [here](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-testnets/blob/main/dydx-testnet-4/gentx/gentx-dydx-1.json) for an example gentx file.

<aside>
üí° Do not manually modify the content of generated `gentx` file (except for filename). This will result in invalid signature for transaction.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° We have a GitHub workflow that validates the submitted `gentx` file. Please verify the content of your `gentx` file if validation fails.

</aside>

## Submit Your `gentx`

1. Fork the [Mainnet Github Repo](https://github.com/dydxopsdao/networks).
 
2. Clone the forked repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your username or organization>/networks.git
```

3. Create a new local branch:

```bash
git checkout -b $DYDX_MONIKER/gentx
```

4. Copy the gentx file to the `networks` repo (ensure that it is in the correct folder)

```bash
cp $HOME_MAINNET_1/config/gentx/gentx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.json v4-mainnets/dydx-mainnet-1/gentx/gentx-$DYDX_MONIKER.json
```

5. Commit and push to your repo.

```bash
git add dydx-mainnet-1/gentx/*
git commit -m "$DYDX_MONIKER gentx"
git push origin $DYDX_MONIKER/gentx
```

6. Create a pull request in the original `dydxopsdao/networks` repo. In other words, the `base repository` should be `dydxopsdao/networks` and the `base branch`` should be `main`. 

7. The maintainers will run the "Validate Genesis" workflow, which runs some sanity checks on the submitted `gentx`. Please try to resolve any issue if the workflow doesn't pass, and post in `#ext-dydx-v4-validators-discussion` if you need help.

8. Maintainers will review and merge the PRs. If you need any help, post in `#ext-dydx-v4-validators-discussion`.
